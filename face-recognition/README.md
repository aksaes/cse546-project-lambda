## Cloud Computing Project 2

These are the instructions to run the project.

1. Run the `workload.py` script to upload the test case videos to input bucket `input-bucket` . The trigger setup will automatically call the OpenFaaS function which would process the file and give the output in the output bucket, for each file.

2. Check the output bucket `output-bucket` to get the output related to each testcase.
